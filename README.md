# AUTOCOMB

Automatically generate combs for your programs. No more manually creating icons for your whatever the fuck and no need to fuck around with electron apps like Discord `--processStart Discord.exe` stfu we copying the .lnk from Start Menu!!!

# Usage

When you load Autocomb.ini it automatically reads and generates combs for each program in your start menu. It misses steam games and other such entries that don't point directly to an .exe (for now).

# F.A.Q.

## I edited an autocomb but all my changes dissapeared??

Autocombs are automatically generated. Every comb is wiped and re-generated whenever you load Autocomb.ini. You're not supposed to edit the generated files by hand.

## You've said you hate launcher skins?

Yes but Autocomb is an interesting project. And I like doing things better than other people :3
